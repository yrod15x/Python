How true the old proverbs are.
My dear, it never rains but it pours. 
Just fancy! THREE proposals in one day! Isnâ€™t it awful! I feel sorry, really and truly sorry, for two of the poor fellows. 
Here am I, who shall be twenty in September, and yet I never had a proposal till to-day, not a real proposal, and to-day I have had three.
